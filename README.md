Horizon is the [client facing API](https://github.com/fonero-project/fonero-golang/tree/master/services/horizon/docs) server for the Fonero Trade Ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between fonero-core and applications that want to access the Fonero network. It allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, subscribe to event streams, etc. See [an overview of the Fonero Trade Ecosystem](https://www.fonero.org/developers/guides/get-started/) for more details.
